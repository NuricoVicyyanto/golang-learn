This repository contains materials and code examples to learn Golang. The goal of this project is to provide simple and practical examples for beginners who want to understand the fundamentals of programming with the Go language.

## Features

- Learn Go's syntax, variables, and data types.
- Understand control flow, loops, and conditionals.
- Explore functions, methods, and interfaces.
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels.
- Build simple applications with Go.

## Installation

To get started with this project, make sure you have Go installed on your computer. Here are the steps to install and run the code locally:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/learning-golang.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd learning-golang
    ```

3. Run the application using Go:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

If you want to run other example code, simply open a file from the `examples/` folder and run it using the same command.

## Usage

Once you have installed and run this project, you can start editing and developing the code in the files provided. Here are some usage examples:

- **Creating simple variables and functions:**
    ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        var name string = "Golang"
        fmt.Println("Happy learning", name)
    }
    ```

- **Using Goroutines for concurrent programming:**
    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
    )

    func printHello() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, Golang!")
    }

    func main() {
        go printHello() // Run function concurrently
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Wait for goroutine to finish
    }
    ```
